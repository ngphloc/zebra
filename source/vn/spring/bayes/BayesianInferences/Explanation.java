 * There are two cases to be considered:                             
 *     EXPLANATION or FULL_EXPLANATION                               
 * the only difference is which variables are considered             
 * explanation variables.                                            
 *                                                                   
 * In FULL_EXPLANATION all variables are                             
 * explanation variables except variables that are observed.         
 *                                                                   
 * In EXPLANATION only variables that are marked as explanation      
 * variables are used in the maximization; an observed variable is   
 * not used even if it is marked as explanation variable.            
 * Note that in EXPLANATION mode, if there are no variables          
 * marked as explanation variables, the final result is the posterior
 * marginal.
