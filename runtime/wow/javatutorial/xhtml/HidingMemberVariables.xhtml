<h2>
Hiding Member Variables
</h2>
<blockquote>
Within a class, a member variable that has the same 
name as a member variable in the superclass hides the 
superclass's member variable, even if their types are 
different. Within the subclass, the member variable in 
the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name. 
Instead, the member variable must be accessed through 
<code>super</code>, which is covered in the next section. 
Generally speaking, we don't recommend hiding member variables.
