<h2>Lesson: Hello World Application</h2>
<blockquote>

Now that you've seen a Java application (and perhaps even compiled and run it), you might be wondering how it works and how similar it is to other Java applications. Remember that a <em>Java application</em> is a standalone Java program--a program written in the Java language that runs independently of any browser.

This section dissects the "Hello World" application you've already seen. Here, again, is its code:
<blockquote>
<pre>
/** 
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply displays &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the standard output.
 */
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); //Display the string.
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="CommentsInCode" class="conditional">Comments in Java Code</a></h3>

<blockquote>
The "Hello World" application has two blocks of comments. The first block, at the top of the program, uses <code>/**</code> and <code>*/</code> elimiters. Later, a line of code is explained with a comment that's marked by <code>//</code> characters. The Java language supports a third kind of comment, as well -- the familiar C-style comment, which is delimited with <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
<a href="CommentsInCode" class="conditional">Comments in Java Code</a> further explains the three forms of comments that the Java language supports.

<h3><a href="DefiningClass" class="conditional">Defining a Class</a></h3>
<blockquote>
In the Java language, each method (function) and variable exists within a <em>class</em> or an <em>object</em> (an instance of a class). The Java language does not support global functions or variables. Thus, the skeleton of any Java program is a <em>class definition</em>.
<a href="DefiningClass" class="conditional">Defining a Class</a> gives you more information.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="MainMethod" class="conditional">The <code>main</code> Method</a></h3>
<blockquote>
The entry point of every Java application is its <code>main</code> method. When you run an application with the Java interpreter, you specify the name of the class that you want to run. The interpreter invokes the <code>main</code> method defined within that class. The <code>main</code> method controls the flow of the program, allocates whatever resources are needed, and runs any other methods that provide the functionality for the application.
<a href="MainMethod" class="conditional">The <code>main</code> Method</a> tells you more.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="ClassesAndObjects" class="conditional">Using Classes and Objects</a></h3>
<blockquote>
The other components of a Java application are the supporting objects, classes, methods, and Java language statements that you write to implement the application.
<a href="ClassesAndObjects" class="conditional">Using Classes and Objects</a> introduces you to these components.
