<h2>Summary of Variables</h2>
<blockquote>

When you declare a variable, you explicitly set the variable's name and data type. The Java programming language has two categories of data types: primitive and reference. A variable of primitive type contains a value. The table in the
<a href="DataTypes" class="conditional">Data Types</a><a href="DataTypes" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a> section shows all of the primitive data types along with their sizes and formats. Keep in mind that a variable of reference type contains a reference to a value. Arrays, classes, and interfaces are reference types.

<p>
The location of a variable declaration implicitly sets the variable's scope, which determines what section of code may refer to the variable by its simple name. There are four categories of scope: member variable scope, local variable scope, parameter scope, and exception-handler parameter scope.
</p>
<p>
You can provide an initial value for a variable within its declaration 
by using the assignment operator (=).
You can declare a variable as final. The value of a final variable 
cannot change after it's been initialized.
