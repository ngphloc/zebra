<h2>Getting the Length of a String or String Buffer</h2>
<blockquote>
Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as <em>accessor methods</em>. One accessor method that you can use with strings, string buffers,  and string builders is the <code>length</code> method, which returns the number of characters contained in the object. After the following two lines of code have been executed, <code>len</code> equals 17: 

<blockquote><pre>
String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
int len = palindrome.length();
</pre></blockquote>

In addition to <code>length</code>, the <code>StringBuffer</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> classes have a method called <code>capacity</code>, which returns the amount of space allocated rather than the amount of space used. For example, the capacity of the string builder referred to by <code>dest</code> in the <code>StringsDemo</code> program never changes, although its length increases by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The following figure shows the capacity and the length of <code>dest</code> after nine characters have been appended to it.

A string buffer or string builder's length is the number of characters it contains; its capacity is the number of character spaces that have been allocated.
<br/><br/>
The <code>String</code> class doesn't have a <code>capacity</code> method, because a string cannot change.
