<h2>
Summary of Managing Inheritance
</h2>
<blockquote>
Except for the <code>Object</code> class, a class has 
exactly one direct superclass. A class inherits member 
variables and methods from all its superclasses, whether 
direct or indirect. A subclass can override methods that 
it inherits, or it can hide variables or methods that it inherits. 

<p>
The table in section 
<a href="OverridingHidingMethods" class="conditional">Overriding and Hiding Methods</a><a href="OverridingHidingMethods" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a> shows the effect of declaring a method with the same signature 
as a method in the superclass.
</p>
The <code>Object</code> class is the top of the class hierarchy. 
All classes are descendants from this class and inherit methods 
from it. Useful methods inherited from <code>Object</code> 
include <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code>, 
<code>clone</code>, <code>getClass</code>, <code>wait</code>, 
<code>notify</code>, and <code>notifyAll</code>.
<p>
You can prevent a class from being subclassed by using the 
<code>final</code> keyword in the class's declaration. Similarly, 
you can prevent a method from being overridden by subclasses by 
declaring it as a final method.
</p>
An abstract class can only be subclassed; it cannot be 
instantiated. An abstract class can contain abstract 
methods &#151; methods that are declared but not implemented. 
Subclasses provide the implementations for abstract methods.
