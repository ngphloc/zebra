<h2>
Warning! Interfaces Cannot Grow
</h2>
<blockquote>
Suppose that you want to add some functionality to <CODE>StockWatcher</CODE>. 
For instance, suppose that you want to add a method that reports 
the current stock price, regardless of whether the value changed: 

<blockquote><pre>
public interface StockWatcher {
    void valueChanged(TickerSymbol tickerSymbol,
                      BigDecimal newValue); 
    void currentValue(TickerSymbol tickerSymbol,
                      BigDecimal newValue); 
}
</pre></blockquote>

However, if you make this change, all classes that implement 
the old <CODE>StockWatcher</CODE> interface will break because 
they don't implement the interface anymore! Programmers relying 
on this interface will protest loudly. 
<br/><br/>
Try to anticipate all uses for your interface up front and specify 
it completely from the beginning. Given that this is often impossible, 
you may need either to create more interfaces later or to break 
your customer's code. For example, you could create a <CODE>StockWatcher</CODE> 
subinterface called <CODE>StockTracker</CODE> that declared the 
new method:

<blockquote><pre>
public interface StockTracker extends StockWatcher {
    void currentValue(TickerSymbol tickerSymbol,
                      BigDecimal newValue);
}
</pre></blockquote>

Now users of your code can choose to upgrade to the new interface
or to stick with the old interface.
