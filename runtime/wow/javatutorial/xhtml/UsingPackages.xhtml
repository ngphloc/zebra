<h2>
Creating and Using Packages
</h2>
<blockquote>
To make types easier to
  find and to use, to avoid naming conflicts, and to control access,
  programmers bundle groups of related types into packages. 
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><hr/><strong>Definition: </strong>
A <i>package</i> is a collection of related types
providing access protection and namespace management. 
Note that <i>types</i> refers to classes, interfaces, enums
and annotations.  For more information on enums, see the
section on
<a href="EnumeratedTypes" class="conditional">Enumerated Types</a><a href="EnumeratedTypes" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a>.
<hr/></blockquote>
<p>
The types that are part of the Java platform 
  are members of various packages that bundle classes by function: 
  fundamental classes are in <code>java.lang</code>, classes for 
  reading and writing (input and output) are in <code>java.io</code>, 
  and so on. You can put your types in packages, too.
</p>
  Let's look at a set of classes and examine why you might want 
  to put them in a package. Suppose that you write a group of classes 
  that represent a collection of graphic objects, such as circles, 
  rectangles, lines, and points. You also write an interface,
  <code>Draggable</code>, 
  that classes implement if they can be dragged with the mouse 
  by the user: 

<blockquote><pre>
//<em>in the Graphic.java file</em>
public abstract class Graphic {
    . . .
}

//<em>in the Circle.java file</em>
public class Circle extends Graphic implements Draggable {
    . . .
}

//<em>in the Rectangle.java file</em>
public class Rectangle extends Graphic implements Draggable {
    . . .
}

//<em>in the Draggable.java file</em>
public interface Draggable {
    . . .
}
</pre></blockquote>

    <br/>You should bundle these classes and the interface in a package
    for several reasons:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>You and other programmers can easily determine that these
      types are related.</li>
      <li>You and other programmers know where to find types
      that provide graphics-related functions.</li>
      <li>The names of your types won't conflict with types names
      in other packages, because the package creates a new namespace.</li>
      <li>You can allow types within the package to have unrestricted
      access to one another yet still restrict access for types outside
      the package.</li>
    </ul>
