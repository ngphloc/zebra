<h2>What Can Java Technology Do?</h2>

<blockquote>

The most common types of programs written in the Java programming language are <em>applets</em> and <em>applications</em>. If you've surfed the Web, you're probably already familiar with applets. An applet is a program that adheres to certain conventions that allow it to run within a Java-enabled browser. At the <a href="GettingStarted" class="conditional">"Getting Started"</a> is an applet that displays an animation of the Java technology's mascot, Duke, waving at you.

<p>
However, the Java programming language is not just for writing cute, entertaining applets for the Web. The general-purpose, high-level Java programming language is also a powerful software platform. Using the generous API, you can write many types of programs.
</p>

<p>
An application is a standalone program that runs directly on the Java platform. A special kind of application known as a <em>server</em> serves and supports clients on a network. Examples of servers are Web servers, proxy servers, mail servers, and print servers. Another specialized program is a <em>servlet</em>. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that runs on the server side. Java Servlets are a popular choice for building interactive web applications, replacing the use of CGI scripts. Servlets are similar to applets in that they are runtime extensions of applications. Instead of working in browsers, though, servlets run within Java Web servers, configuring or tailoring the server.
</p>

How does the API support all these kinds of programs? It does so with packages of software components that provide a wide range of functionality. Every full implementation of the Java platform gives you the following features:
<ul>
<li><strong>The essentials</strong>: Objects, strings, threads, numbers, input and output, data structures, system properties, date and time, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Applets</strong>: The set of conventions used by applets.</li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong>: URLs, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol) sockets, and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>: Help for writing programs that can be localized for users worldwide. Programs can automatically adapt to specific locales and be displayed in the appropriate language.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Both low level and high level, including electronic signatures, public and private key management, access control, and certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Software components</strong>: Known as JavaBeans<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>, can plug into existing component architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Object serialization</strong>: Allows lightweight persistence and communication via Remote Method Invocation (RMI).</li>
<li><strong>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>)</strong>:Provides uniform access to a wide range of relational databases.</li>
</ul>

The Java platform also has APIs for 2D and 3D graphics, accessibility, servers, collaboration, telephony, speech, animation, and more. The following figure depicts what is included in the Java 2 SDK.

<strong>Note: </strong>The Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v. 1.3. The Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) consists of the virtual machine, the Java platform core classes, and supporting files. The Java 2 SDK includes the JRE and development tools such as compilers and debuggers.
