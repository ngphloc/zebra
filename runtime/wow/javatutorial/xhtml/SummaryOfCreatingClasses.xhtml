Summary of Creating Classes
</h2>
<blockquote>
A class definition has two parts: a class declaration and a 
class body. For details about the elements of a class declaration, refer to 
the table in the section 
<a href="ControllingAccessToClass" class="conditional">Controlling Access to Members of a Class</a><a href="ControllingAccessToClass" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a>. The class body contains member variables, methods, and 
constructors for the class. A class uses member variables 
to contain state and uses methods to implement behavior. 
The table in 
<a href="DeclaringClasses" class="conditional">Declaring Classes</a><a href="DeclaringClasses" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a> lists the possible elements of a member variable declaration and 
the table in the section 
<a href="DeclaringMemberVariables" class="conditional">Declaring Member Variables</a><a href="DeclaringMemberVariables" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a> lists the possible elements of a method declaration. Constructors 
initialize a new instance of a class and have the same name as the class.

<p>
You control access to member variables and methods in the same way: 
by using an access specifier, such as <code>private</code> or 
<code>public</code>, in the member's declaration. The table in section 
<a href="DefiningMethods" class="conditional">Defining Methods</a><a href="DefiningMethods" class="conditional"><img src="images/tutorialIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the Learning the Java Language trail)"/></a>
lists the access specifiers and the effect of each specifier.
</p>

You specify a class member variable or a class method by using 
the <code>static</code> keyword in the member's declaration. A 
member that is not declared as <code>static</code> is implicitly 
an instance member. Class variables are shared by all instance of 
a class and can be accessed through the class name. Instances of 
a class get their own copy of each instance variable, which must be 
accessed through an instance reference.
