<h2>
Summary of Nested Classes
</h2>
<blockquote>
A class defined within another class is called a 
nested class. Like other members of a class, a 
nested class can be declared static or not. A 
nonstatic nested class is called an inner class. 
An instance of an inner class can exist only 
within an instance of its enclosing class and 
has access to its enclosing class's 
members even if they are declared private.
