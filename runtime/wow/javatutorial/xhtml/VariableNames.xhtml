<h2>Variable Names</h2>
<blockquote>

A program refers to a variable's value by the variable's name. For example, when it displays the value of the <code>largestByte</code> variable, the <code>MaxVariablesDemo</code> program uses the name <code>largestByte</code>. A name, such as <code>largestByte</code>, that's composed of a single identifier is called a <em>simple name</em>. Simple names are in contrast to <em>qualified</em> names, which a class uses to refer to a member variable that's in another object or class. This topic is covered further in the section

<p>
In the Java programming language, the following must hold true for a simple name:
<ul>
<li>
It must be a legal identifier. Recall from the preceding section that an identifier is an unlimited series of Unicode characters that begins with a letter.
</li>
<li>
It must not be a <code>keyword</code>, a boolean literal (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), or the reserved word <code>null</code>.
</li>
<li>
It must be unique within its scope. A variable may have the same name as a variable whose declaration appears in a different scope. In some situations, a variable may share names with another variable, which is declared in a nested scope. Scope is covered in the next section. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<blockquote><hr/><strong>By Convention: </strong>Variable names begin with a lowercase letter, and class names begin with an uppercase letter. If a variable name consists of more than one word, the words are joined together, and each word after the first begins with an uppercase letter, like this: <code>isVisible</code>. The underscore character (<code> _ </code>) is acceptable anywhere in a name, but by convention is used only to separate words in constants (because constants are all caps by convention and thus cannot be case-delimited).
