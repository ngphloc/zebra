<h2>
Lesson: Interfaces and Packages
</h2>
<blockquote>
This chapter talks about two Java
programming language features that help you to manage relationships
between classes that might not otherwise be related by the class
hierarchy. First, you learn how to write and use an interface &#151; a
protocol of communication between objects. Second, you will learn
how to bundle classes and interfaces into packages.

<blockquote>
You saw an example of implementing an interface in the previous
chapter. You can read more about interfaces &#151; what they are for, why you
might need to write an interface, and all about how to write one &#151; in
this section.
