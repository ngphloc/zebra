<h2>
Creating Classes
</h2>
<blockquote>
This section shows you the main components of a class by 
using a small example that implements a stack &#151; a data 
structure whose items are added and removed in a 
last-in-first-out (LIFO) fashion. The following figure 
shows the <code>Stack</code> class and identifies the 
elements of a class.

A class definition has two main components: the <i>class declaration</i> 
and the <i>class body</i>. The class declaration is the first line of 
code in a class. At a minimum, the class declaration declares the name of 
the class.

<p>
The class body follows the class declaration and appears between 
braces &#151; <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. The class body contains 
all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from 
the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for 
the variables that provide the state of the class and its objects, and 
methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects. The 
<code>Stack</code> class defines two member variables within the class 
body &#151; the <code>items</code> list and <code>top</code>, the array 
index of the top of the stack. The <code>Stack</code> class also defines 
one constructor which takes one argument and three methods: <code>push</code>, 
<code>pop</code>, and <code>isEmpty</code>.
