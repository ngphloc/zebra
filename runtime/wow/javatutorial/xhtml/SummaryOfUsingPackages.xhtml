<h2>
Summary of Creating and Using Packages
</h2>
<blockquote>
<!--Summary-->

To create a package, you put a type (class, interface, enum or annotation)
    in it. 
    To put a class or an interface into a package, you put a <CODE>package</CODE> 
    statement as the first statement in the source file for the class 
    or the interface. The path name of the source and class file 
    of a class or an interface mirrors the name of the package. 
    
    <p>
    To use a class or an interface that's in a different package, 
    you have three choices: You can use the fully qualified name 
    of the class or the interface, you can import the class or the 
    interface, or you can import the entire package of which the 
    class or the interface is a member. 
    </p>
    You might have to set your class path so that the compiler and 
    the interpreter can find the source and class files for your 
    classes and interfaces.
