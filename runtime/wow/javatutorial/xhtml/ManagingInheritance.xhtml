Managing Inheritance

The 
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html"><font color="#8800bb"><code>Object</code></font></a><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html"><img src="images/apiIcon.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt=" (in the API reference documentation)"/></a> class, defined in the <code>java.lang</code> package, defines 
and implements behavior that every class needs. As depicted in 
the following figure, many classes derive from <code>Object</code>, 
many classes derive from those classes, and so on, forming a 
hierarchy of classes.
<p><center><img src="images/classes-object.gif" width="440" height="241" align="bottom" alt="All Classes are Descendants of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;"/></center></p>
At the top of the hierarchy, <code>Object</code> is the most 
general of all classes. Classes near the bottom of the hierarchy 
provide more specialized behavior. A <i>subclass</i> derives 
from another class. The term <i>superclass</i> refers to a 
class's direct ancestor or to any of its ascendant classes. 
Every class has one and only one immediate superclass. 
<br/><br/>
A subclass inherits all the member variables and methods from 
its superclass. However, the subclass might not have access to 
an inherited member variable or method. For example, a subclass 
cannot access a private member inherited from its superclass. 
One might say, then, that the item was not inherited at all. But 
the item <i>is</i> inherited. This becomes important when using 
an inner class, which does have access to its enclosing class's 
private members. Note that constructors are not members and 
so are not inherited by subclasses.
