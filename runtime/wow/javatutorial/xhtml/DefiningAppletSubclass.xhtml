<h2>Defining an Applet Subclass</h2>
<blockquote>
The first bold line of the following listing begins a block that defines the <code>HelloWorld</code> class.

<blockquote><pre>
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

<b>public class HelloWorld extends Applet {</b>
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString("Hello world!", 50, 25);
    }
<b>}</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The <code>extends</code> keyword indicates that HelloWorld is a subclass of the class whose name follows: <code>Applet</code>. If the term <em>subclass</em> means nothing to you, you'll learn about it soon in

</p>

From the <code>Applet</code> class, applets inherit a great deal of functionality. Perhaps most important is the ability to respond to browser requests. For example, when a Java-capable browser loads a page containing an applet, the browser sends a request to the applet, telling the applet to initialize itself and start executing. You'll learn more about what the Applet class provides in the

<p>
An applet isn't restricted to defining just one class. Besides the necessary <code>Applet</code> subclass, an applet can define additional custom classes. When the applet attempts to use a class, the application that's executing the applet first looks on the local host for the class. If the class isn't available locally, it's loaded from the location that the <code>Applet</code> subclass originated from.
