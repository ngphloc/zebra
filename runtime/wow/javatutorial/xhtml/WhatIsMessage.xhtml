<h2>What Is a Message?</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>
A single object alone is generally not very useful. Instead, an object usually appears as a component of a larger program or application that contains many other objects. Through the interaction of these objects, programmers achieve higher-order functionality and more complex behavior. Your bicycle hanging from a hook in the garage is just a bunch of metal and rubber; by itself, the bicycle is incapable of any activity. The bicycle is useful only when another object (you) interacts with it (pedal).
</p>

Software objects interact and communicate with each other by sending <em>messages</em> to each other. When object A wants object B to perform one of B's methods, object A sends a message to object B (see the following figure).

Sometimes, the receiving object needs more information so that it knows exactly what to do; for example, when you want to change gears on your bicycle, you have to indicate which gear you want. This information is passed along with the message as <em>parameters</em>.

<br/>
The next figure shows the three parts of a message:
<ul>
<li>The object to which the message is addressed (<code>YourBicycle</code>)</li>
<li>The name of the method to perform (<code>changeGears</code>)</li>
<li>Any parameters needed by the method (<code>lowerGear</code>)</li>
</ul>

These three components are enough information for the receiving object to perform the desired method. No other information or context is required.
<br/>

Messages provide two important benefits.
<ul>
<li>
An object's behavior is expressed through its methods, so (aside from direct variable access) message passing supports all possible interactions between objects.
</li>
<li>
Objects don't need to be in the same process or even on the same machine to send and receive messages back and forth to each other.
</li>
</ul>
