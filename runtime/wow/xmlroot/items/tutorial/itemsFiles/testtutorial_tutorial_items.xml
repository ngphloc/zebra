(There can be more than one true statement.)</enunciate><image /><answers numberOfCorrect="2" numberOfAnswers="6"><answer codeAnswer="1"><textAnswer>AHA! works on machines where the mySQL database is not installed.</textAnswer><correct>true</correct><explanation>The code for accessing mySQL is included in the Java SDK, so AHA! will not complain that mySQL is missing. But of course you cannot use the option to store the concepts and user models in a mySQL database when you do not have mySQL installed.</explanation></answer><answer codeAnswer="2"><textAnswer>In an AHA! application there can be links that are underlined while other links are not underlined.</textAnswer><correct>true</correct><explanation>In AHA! the "conditional" and "unconditional" links are not underlined, but links to pages that are unrelated to the application's concept structure are shown with or without underlining depending on your browser's settings.</explanation></answer><answer codeAnswer="3"><textAnswer>AHA! is completely free.</textAnswer><correct>true</correct><explanation>AHA! is distributed under the GNU license. This guarantees that it is available for free, and also that you get free access to the complete source code. Furthermore, AHA! only relies on tools that are available for free as well (and many also under a GNU license or a similar license).</explanation></answer><answer codeAnswer="4"><textAnswer>AHA! is primarily an educational system.</textAnswer><correct>false</correct><explanation>AHA! can be used for many different types of adaptive applications. The only educational feature it offers is the multiple-choice module and that is not yet fully developed. It does not come with an authoring tool for instance.</explanation></answer><answer codeAnswer="5"><textAnswer>AHA! works well with all browsers on all platforms.</textAnswer><correct>false</correct><explanation>Unfortunately there are browsers with bugs in their implementation of HTTP or their support for HTML. These are mostly older ones, but many of them are still in use. Netscape 4 works reasonably well, although there are surprises with some aspects of xhtml which Netscape 4 was not designed for. Netscape 6 and 7 work well. Internet Explorer has problems with almost all versions, but with the latest version there should be no problem if you do not visit any webpages before going to an AHA! site.</explanation></answer><answer codeAnswer="6"><textAnswer>AHA! 2.0 is backward compatible with AHA! 1.0.</textAnswer><correct>false</correct><explanation>The concept structure in AHA! 2.0 is completely different from 1.0, and this has an effect on the adaptation rules and the conditional inclusion of fragments. Porting an AHA! 1.0 application to 2.0 is fairly straightforward, but AHA! 2.0 offers a much richer concept structure, so it would be a shame to make a simple translation of a 1.0 application to 2.0 without taking advantage of the new possibilities.</explanation></answer></answers><irtParameters><difficulty>0.0</difficulty><discrimination>1.0</discrimination><guessing>0.16666666666666666</guessing></irtParameters><statisticParameters><exhibitionRate>0.0</exhibitionRate><answerTime>0</answerTime><successRate>0.0</successRate><numberOfUses>0</numberOfUses><numberOfSuccesses>0</numberOfSuccesses></statisticParameters><testFiles><classicTest><classicTestFilePath>tutorial/test/testtutorial_tutorial_C_activity.xml</classicTestFilePath></classicTest></testFiles></question></questions></fileOfQuestions>
