<p>
Thank you for your interest in WOW! 1.0 as your adaptive Web-based system.
You are now viewing the main starting page of the WOW! distribution.
From this page you can go to the following sub-parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <a href="Config">configuration</a> link leads to an
interface for manipulating the different WOW! data structures.
It lets you choose between the use of XML files or a
mySQL database for the concept structures and the user models,
and lets you convert authoring formats to internal formats.
It lets you define authors and assign applications to authors.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="author/AMt/AMt.html">Application Management Tool</a>
is the main authoring tool. It lets you transfer files from your
local machine to the server and back, and lets you start most
authoring tools by simply clicking on the names of the authoring files.
</li>
<li>
In the <a href="AuthorWorkplace">Author Workplace</a> you can
change your settings as an author, and access all the authoring tools.
Authorization is required to change your author settings.
You can also access the authoring tools directly from the
The <a href="author/">authoring</a> page. (The tools ask for
authorization when you start them.)
</li>
<!--<li>The <a href="author/StrategiesEditor/StrategiesEditor.html">Strategies Editor</a> lets you create instructional (meta-)strategies for user's learning style.</li>-->
</ul>
