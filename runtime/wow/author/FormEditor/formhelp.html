<li><h3>Main Window</h3>
The main window contains 3 parts:
<ul>
<li><b>The concept-tree:</b> On the lefthandside you can find a tree that contains concepts and their attributes.
With the attributes comes an indication whether or not they are changeable.
</li>
<li><b>The editor panes:</b> In the middle of the FormEditor you can see an editor pane that will contain the XML
for the form in construction. This pane can be interchanged with a preview of the constructed form.
</li>
<li><b>Toolbar with buttons:</b> At the bottom there is a toolbar with buttons; they are used to construct elements for
the form with a small interface.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Constructing a form</h3>
There are two ways of constructing a form: the first one is for more experienced user who know the syntax; they can simply
type the appropriate XML in the editor pane. For the users that don't know the exact syntax, there is another easy way.
The user selects an attribute of a concept for which he wants to construct a form element. After that, he chooses what element
to construct, and clicks the matching button. An interface appears, which the users fills in, after which the wanted element
is added to the form.
</li>
</ol>
