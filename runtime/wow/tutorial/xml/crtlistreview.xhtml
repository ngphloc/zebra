class="unconditional">list that comes with this WOW! release and tutorial</a>
contains a number of concept relationship types for illustration purposes,
as well as some commonly used ones like "knowledge_propagation",
"knowledge update" and "prerequisite". The list is extracted from a
list of templates. You can <a href="concepttemplate.xhtml"
class="conditional">create your own templates</a>, but that requires
a thorough knowledge of the WOW! adaptation rule language.</p>
