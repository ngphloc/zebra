<h2>Define the Event Condition Access Rules or the Adaptation Rules</h2>

<p>To generate <a href="rules" class="conditional"><object
name="tutorial.adaptationrule" type="wow/text" /> rules</a>
that define the adaptation behavior associated with the application
just save the application, using button
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphsavebutton.gif" width="30" height="30" />. <br />
The <a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">Graph Author Tool</a> will
automatically generate two files named "example.gaf" and
"example.wow". You can see the files in the "Author Files Tab"
in <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/amt.gif" target="_blank" class="unconditional">AMT</a>. </p>
<p>The ".gaf" extension is what is used by the
<a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">Graph Author Tool</a> to recreate
the graph(ical) presentation. To open an already saved aplication
double click on the ".gaf" file. </p>
<p>Commit the saved application to the running WOW! system by using
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphcommitbutton.gif" width="30" height="30" />.
Only when edits are "committed" do they affect end-users that log in to
the application. You can safely edit an application and save results a number
of times. You only "commit" the application when you are confident
that the structure is right and that end-users should start using it.
