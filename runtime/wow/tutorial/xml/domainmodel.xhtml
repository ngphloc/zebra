<h2>The WOW! Domain Model</h2>

<p>
Each WOW! application consists of a set of
<a href="concepts" class="conditional">concepts</a>,
with associated attributes and
<object name="tutorial.adaptationrule" type="text/wow" />
<a href="rules" class="conditional">rules</a>.
Most concepts are associated with
<a href="pages" class="conditional">pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to create the conceptual structure of the domain model
we recommend that you use the
<a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">graph author</a> tool.
Advanced authors may wish to have a look at the
low level <a href="concepteditor" class="conditional">concept editor</a>
which allows complete control over the adaptive behavior of WOW!,
but which is much more difficult to use.
