<h2>The Application Management Tool</h2>

<p>
In order to manage an application as an author the <em>application
management tool</em>, or AMT for short, offers a user-friendly
interface to copy files between your local PC and the WOW! server.
AMT works as a <em>signed</em> Java applet, in order to be able to access
your local file system. The figure below shows the AMT interface.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The left half of the window gives an "explorer-like" view of
your local file system. The right half can either show the
<em>application files</em> which are all the files that you create
as an author and that the server uses when the application is running.
The alternative view shows the <em>author files</em> which are
the files that are created using the special WOW! authoring
tools for the <a href="domainmodel" class="conditional">domain model</a>.
When you double-click on one of these files the appropriate authoring
tool is started automatically.
The files created by the authoring tools
(<a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">Graph Author</a> and
<a href="concepteditor" class="conditional">Concept Editor</a>)
are not stored on your PC, only on the server.
</p>

<p>
AMT lets you create a new application (including a folder for
the "Application Files" and skeleton "Author Files".
You can right-click on an application to select an authoring
tool to open, and you can also opt to delete the domain model
from WOW!. This means that although the files remain (you can
delete those as well, but separately) the WOW! server will no
longer serve the application.
<br />
When you install a new WOW! distribution, it comes with this
tutorial pre-installed. You can use the "delete domain model
from WOW!" command in AMT to stop serving the tutorial from
your server.
