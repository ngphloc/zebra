<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A concept is an abstract entity. It can correspond to number of things
like text fragments, whole pages and even more complex structures.<br />
There are two types of structures :</p>
<ol>
<li>
Atomic Concepts : Text fragments are termed as atomic concepts.
</li>
<li>
Composite Concepts : We consider two types of composite concepts:
<strong>pages and abstract concepts.</strong> Pages are composites of
which all the children are fragments, or atomic concepts.
Abstract concepts are composites of which all the children are composite
concepts (either abstract or pages).
