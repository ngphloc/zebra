<h2>Creating Multiple-Choice Tests</h2>

<p>
Although WOW! is not primarily intended to be an educational tool,
it has found educational applications (first), and some type of
assessment is necessary in a learning application, hence the
facility for creating and using multiple-choice tests.
</p>
<p>
The University of Cordoba (Spain) has kindly donated an environment
for creating and using <em>classic</em> and <em>adaptive</em>
multiple-choice tests.
</p>
<p>
WOW! 1.0 comes with a (new) authoring tool for different types of
multiple-choice tests: the (<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/testeditor.gif"
target="_blank" class="unconditional">Test Editor</a>).
Test Editor is an authoring tool for building <em>adaptive</em>
(and randomized) and <em>classic</em> (non-randomized) multiple-choice tests.
The specific life cycle of tests we have used is:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/testlifecycle.gif" />:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Before designing a multiple-choice test the course concept structure
must have been created (using the
<a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">Graph Author</a> or the
<a href="concepteditor" class="conditional">Concept Editor</a>).
A multiple-choice test will evaluate the user's knowledge of one or more
of the previously defined concepts.
</li>
<li>
The second step is to build an <em>items file</em> or <em>questions file</em>
for the test. (A test may use several items files.)
Each items file contains questions that evaluate the user's knowledge
about a single concept.
The items file creation starts with		
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/selectconceptincreatefileitem.gif"
target="_blank" class="unconditional">selecting the concept</a>
that is evaluated by the question, and by indicating a default
number of answers for each question.
The next step is to add questions to the file, one by one, setting some
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/obligatoryparametersitem.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">obligatory parameters</a> (like the enunciate flag,
the answers and a flag to indicate whether the answers are correct),
and some optional parameters (like image, explanation and
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/optionalparametersitem.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">Item Response Theory  (IRT) parameters</a>:
item difficulty and discrimination). 
The items are stored in an XML file. An items file can be loaded again
to inspect it, add more items, or change or delete existing ones.
</li>
<li>The third step is to build tests out of items.
Creating a test consist of selecting a number of items and
setting some configuration parameters
(the type of test, number of questions, etc.).
First you have to select the course and decide which
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/selecttestype.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">test type</a> (classic test or adaptive test)
you want to create, and whether to use just one or several items files
(to evaluate just one or several concepts).
If the test evaluates only one concept we consider it to be an "activity".
If the test evaluates several concepts we consider it to be an
"exam", about one chapter or a whole course.
Next, you
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/selectionfileitem.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">select the specific items files</a>
and the maximum number of items of each file.
You can use <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/selectionmethod.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">different methods</a> to select which specific items
from these items files will be used in the test 
(the selection can be done manually, randomly or randomly with some
restrictions). 
Then you set
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/parametershown.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">parameters about how questions are shown</a>
to the students
(the order in which questions and answers are shown,
to show or hide explanations of the answers through the "verbose" flag,
the maximum time to respond, whether show the correct answer or just a score,
etc.),
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/parametersevaluation.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">parameters about test evaluation</a>
(to penalize incorrect answers, to penalize questions without an answer
and what percentage of knowledge the final score represents in the
associated concept or concepts)
and <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/parameterswebpage.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">parameters about the web page</a> that will show
the test to the user.
If the test is adaptive, you also have to set the
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/adaptivetestparameters.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">adaptive algorithm parameters</a>
(question selection procedure, IRT model of 1, 2 or 3 parameters,
and termination criterion). 
Finally, each test is stored in an XML file that is prepared to be used
in an WOW! course or mobile application.
(We have an
<a href="http://localhost:8080/wow/lib/TestEditor.jar">example of a mobile
test .jar file</a> that be downloaded
into a mobile telephone using Bluetooth, Infrared, serial bus, etc.).
Creating mobile tests requires software not needed for a normal
WOW! installation, including J2ME (mobile java software development kit).
</li>
<li>
In order to use (to provide a link to) a previously created test in an WOW!
application, you must use a link of the form:
<pre>
&lt;a href="nameofthetestfile.xml|DoAppletTest"&gt;link anchor&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
The suffix "<tt>|DoAppletTest</tt> tells the WOW! engine to serve the
test Applet to the browser.
Multiple-choice tests are always served through a Java Applet
that not only controls the presentation and the interaction,
but also monitors the maximum amount of time the end-user has for
answering a question.
This tutorial includes an
<a href="testtutorial_tutorial_C_activity.xml|DoAppletTest">example test</a>
through which you can not only check your knowledge of a small part
of this tutorial but that also simply shows how multiple-choice tests
are shown to the end-user.
<br />
When a student starts a test (by clicking in the test link),
then some
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/testinformation.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">starting information</a> is normally shown,
explaining the kind of test, number of questions, time to answer, etc.
The real test begins when the user presses the 
"Begin Test" button.
Each
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/showquestion.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">question</a> is shown separately, and has to be answered
in order to move to the next question. (The user must press the
"Correct The Question" button.)
The feedback whether the answer was
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/correctanswer.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">correct</a> or
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/incorrectanswer.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">incorrect</a> may or may not include an additional
explanation, depending on parameters of the test.
After the final question the system gives a
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/finalscore.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">final score</a>.
<br />
As an author you can decide whether students can repeat a test or not.
</li>
<li>
After students have executed tests, you can perform maintenance
by carrying out modifications to items and tests files.
In order to facilitate this task, the Test Editor shows
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/teststatistic.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">statistics</a> about students' usage
(questions success percentage, mean times to answer the questions,
questions usage percentage, etc.) to help you in making decisions
about future changes to the tests.
You can not only decide to modify or delete bad items, and to add new items,
but also to
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/edittest.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">edit the test configuration</a> .
You can also allow certain students to repeat certain tests,
or grant or deny them access to certain tests.
You can also perform a <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/calibrateitemfile.gif"
target="_blank" class="unconditional">"calibration" of the items files</a>
of a classic test, to transform it into adaptive one,
or to optimaze the items IRT parameters in an adaptive test.
