<h2>Create Thoretical/Conceptual Structure </h2>
<p align="left">Creating a structure is more of a pencil and paper
thing and doesn't involve much of a use of a computer.
Creating a structure may involve many steps like</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deciding on the information content of the application.</li>
  <li>Dividing the information in your application into appropriate
  textual and graphical structures.</li>
  <li>Sectioning and Sub-sectioning of the included content to create pages etc.</li>
  <li>Deciding upon the hierarchy of the various pages. </li>
  <li>Following a systematic naming guideline and assign resources
  to pages accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our application will use the following strucuture (which more
or less resembles the structure of a book )</p>
<ol>
  <li>Welcome Page </li>
  <li>History of HTML</li>
  <li>Basic Constructs of HTML
    <ul>
  	<li>Document Tags</li>
	<li>Lists</li>
    <li>Text Structure Tags </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Advanced Consructs of HTML
  	<ul>
  	<li>Special Tags</li>
	<li>Anchors</li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>Final Words</li>
</ol>
<p>
The hierarchy of an application can be decided upon by various
scientific structures or schemes. You can a choose a structure
of your choice.<br />
We present the hierarchy of our example using a tree structure,
where the various nodes of the tree represent the various concepts
or pages of our application.
