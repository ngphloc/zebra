<h2>The Graph Author Tool</h2>

<p>
The Graph Author is the main authoring tool for the concept structure.
It lets you create a concept hierarchy and concept relationships of
different types. We briefly describe the use of the Graph Author here,
using a series of screen dumps to guide you through the process.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When you start the Graph Author it first asks for a login and password.
(If you start it from the
<a href="amt" class="conditional">application management tool</a>
you do not have to authenticate yourself in the graph author as you
already did that in AMT.)
As of WOW! 2.0 authors are identified and have separate work spaces.
The manager can add new authors, either as part of the
<a href="installation" class="conditional">initial installation</a>
or at a later time using the
<a href="firstconfig" class="conditional">configuration menu</a>.
</li>
<li>
After logging in the
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/graphauthor.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">main Graph Author window</a>
appears. It consists of four main parts:
<ul>
<li>
Top left: menus and buttons. The functions of WOW are all available
through the ten buttons <img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphauthorbuttons.gif" />
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphnewbutton.gif" align="left" />
Create a new WOW! application. You are asked for a confirmation if
this action would wipe out edits in the application you are editing.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphopenbutton.gif" align="left" />
Open an WOW! application. Through a pop-up dialog you can select
one of the applications for which you are an author.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphsavebutton.gif" align="left" />
Save the current WOW! application. This saves the application in
the Graph Author format. It then also generates the concepts and 
<a href="rules" class="conditional"><object name="tutorial.adaptationrule" type="text/wow" /> rules</a>.
that define the adaptation behavior associated with the application.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphcommitbutton.gif" align="left" />
Commit the saved application to the running WOW! system.
Only when edits are "committed" do they affect end-users that log in to
the application. You can safely edit an application and save results
a number of times. You only "commit" the application when you are confident
that the structure is right and that end-users should start using it.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphnewconceptbutton.gif" align="left"/>
Add a new concept to the concept hierarchy, as a child of the currently
highlighted concept in the hierarchy. (More about this below.)
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphfilterbutton.gif" align="left" />
Filter concept relations lets you select which types of relationships are
drawn in the "graph window". It only affects the drawing, not the resulting
graph structure. All relationships that are defined are always saved,
but filtering some types out of the view keeps the display more
understandable.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphcyclesbutton.gif" align="left" />
The graph of concept relationships produced by the Graph Author may
contain cycles. In some cases this may lead to an infinite loop
in the execution of the
<object name="tutorial.adaptationrule" type="text/wow" />
<a href="rules" class="conditional">rules</a>:
by the WOW! engine. The cycle-detection button checks whether there
is a possible danger for such loops. The test is <em>conservative</em>,
meaning that it may sometimes give a false warning, but it will not
miss any rule execution cycles that could be present.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphnozoombutton.gif" align="left" />
Zoom 1:1 resets the zoom level in the "graph window" to normal.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphzoominbutton.gif" align="left" />
Zoom in: enlarges the "graph window" zoom factor, showing a smaller
part of the graph with larger icons.
<br clear="all" />
<img src="/wow/tutorial/images/graphzoomoutbutton.gif" align="left" />
Zoom out: shows more of the concept relationship graph by reducing
the size of the icons. This is most useful for getting the overall
picture of very large concept structure.
</li>
<li>
Top right: through a pull-down menu you can select the
type for newly created concept relationships.
The <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/crtlist.gif" target="_blank" class="unconditional">list
that comes with this WOW! release and tutorial</a> contains a number
of concept relationship types for illustration purposes,
as well as some commonly used ones like "knowledge_propagation",
"knowledge update" and "prerequisite".
The list is extracted from a list of templates.
You can <a href="templates" class="conditional">create your
own templates</a>, but that requires a thorough knowledge of the
WOW! adaptation rule language.
</li>
<li>
Bottom left: the "concept hierarchy" window.
It shows the concept structure in a way that vaguely resembles the
windows explorer. We have an
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/concepthierarchy.gif" target="_blank" class="unconditional">example
concept hierarchy</a> for this tutorial.
The concept hierarchy defines <em>knowledge propagation</em> relationships,
so it is important to place concepts correctly in the hierarchy when
creating them. The hierarchy is also used to automatically generate
certain views like a table of contents.
</li>
<li>
Bottom right: this is the "graph window", showing the graph of
concept relationships (possibly filtered). It does not show the
knowledge propagation through the concept hierarchy, not even
when this type of relationship is explicitly not filtered out.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
When creating a new concept the
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/graphaddconcept.gif"
target="_blank" class="unconditional">add concept dialog box</a> pops up.
For each concept four fields need to be filled out:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b>: This is the name of the concept. It is shown in the
concept hierarchy and used in the concept relationships and
<object name="tutorial.adaptationrule" type="text/wow" />
<a href="rules" class="conditional">rules</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Description</b>: An explanation intended for your self or other
authors to know what the concept is about. This description is not used
by WOW! in any way.
</li>
<li>
<b>Resource</b>: If the concept is directly associated with a page
the URL of that page is given. For a local file the resource starts
with "file:/" and has a path relative to the root of the WOW! root.
The page you are reading now is "file:/tutorial/xml/graphauthor.xhtml".
</li>
<li>
<b>Template</b>: There are five "standard" templates for a concept:
a <em>page concept</em> has an associated resource and has a
<em>knowledge update</em> relationship with itself to indicate
that there is a knowledge increase associated with the page access;
a <em>container page concept</em> is the same, but used for the top
level page of a chapter (or section) for which the knowledge comes
mostly from reading the "sub" page concepts and not from the top-level
page itself;
an <em>abstract concept</em> does not have a resource or knowledge
update relationship but is used to group concepts in the concept
hierarchy, hence it is like a container page but without having a page;
a <em>fragment concept</em> is used to perform the
selection of files to include for a conditionally included object,
and a <em>test concept</em> is used to represent a multiple-choice
test (and its results).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In advanced mode the
<a href="/wow/tutorial/images/graphaddconceptadvanced.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">form for adding and editing a concept</a>
contains a number of additional fields:
<ul>
<li>The <b>title</b> indicates how the concept name is presented
(in the navigation menu in the left frame in this tutorial for instance).
</li>
<li>The <b>no commit</b> flag is intended for future use and can
be ignored for now.
</li>
<li>The <b>stability</b> property lets you control whether intended
<a href="usermodel" class="conditional">user model</a> updates are
a) allowed to go through (stability not enabled) b) allowed only once,
after which the attribute values are always frozen, or c) allowed only
once per session, or d) allowed only when the given
Boolan expression becomes false.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
By right-clicking on a concept in the concept hierarchy a pop-up
menu appears that lets you cut and paste the concept (to move it
to a different position), delete or edit it, to create a new
concept as a child of the current node in the hierarchy,
or to assign resources to a concept used for the conditional
inclusion of objects.
</li>
<li>
Concepts can be dragged to the "graph window" in order to include
them in a concept relationship. Concepts in the "graph window" can
be dragged to any location to make the graph more pleasing.
To drag a concept inside the "graph window" you should not click
exactly on the center of the rectangle representing the concept.
</li>
<li>
To draw concept relationships you
must start by clicking in the center of the rectangle and then
dragging an arrow to the destination of the relationship.
A relationship is created of the current type, so the type should
be selected first, before you draw the relationship.<br />
Double-clicking on the arrow opens a box in which a number can be typed.
This can have a meaning like a percentage of knowledge to transfer,
or a required percentage of knowledge for a <em>prerequisite</em>
to be fulfilled.<br />
By clicking on an arrow and then pressing the "delete" key
a relationship is deleted.
</li>
<li>
By right-clicking on a concept in the "graph window" you can
create a unary relationship (from the concept to itself).
A <a href="/wow/tutorial/images/unarypopup.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">unary relation dialog box</a>
lets you select which unary relation to create.
An example is a <em>knowledge update</em> that associates a knowledge
update with the access to a page.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An easy way to explore the Graph Author is to have the manager
make you an author of this tutorial. You can then explore
the tutorial concept structure using the Graph Author, edit
the concepts and concept relationships, etc.
