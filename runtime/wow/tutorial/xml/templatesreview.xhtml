<h3>Further explanation</h3>
<p>
The concept structure can be created using the high level
<a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">graph author tool</a>,
the low level <a href="concepteditor" class="conditional">concept editor</a>
or by directly editing the XML file that contains the application's concept
structure. In order to create the conceptual structure of the
<a href="domainmodel" class="conditional">domain model</a> we recommend
that you
use the <a href="graphauthor" class="conditional">graph author tool</a>.
Advanced authors may wish to have a look at the low level
<a href="concepteditor" class="conditional">concept editor</a> which allows
complete control over the adaptive behavior of WOW!,
but which is much more difficult to use.</p>
<h4>Templates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A
    <em>page concept</em> represents a single page and has an associated
    resource and a <em>knowledge update</em> relationship with itself
    to indicate that there is a knowledge increase associated with the
    page access.</li>
  <li>A <em>container page concept</em> is a composite concept of which
    that has an associated page and of which all the children are either
    pages or container page concepts.</li>
  <li>An <em>abstract concept</em> does not have a resource or knowledge
    update relationship but is used to group concepts in the concept
    hierarchy. (It is like a container page but without the page.)</li>
