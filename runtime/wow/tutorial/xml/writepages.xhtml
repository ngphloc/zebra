<h2>Write Pages</h2>
<p>The application in itself not only constitutes of the conceptual structure,
but also pages written in a specific language which represent the various
<a href="concepts" class="conditional">concepts</a> used.</p>
<p>A model set of pages is created for your reference.
The WOW! distribution contains a directory "example" with a set
of pages to be used for the example application.
These pages are actually in HTML, not XHTML, but WOW! automatically
converts HTML to XHTML in order to be able to process it.
</p>
<p>For further reference on how to create pages check out the
<a href="pages" class="conditional">page format</a> section
of the tutorial.
